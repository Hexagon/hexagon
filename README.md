Hi, I'm Hexagon! 

As an active open-source developer, I've developed and maintained several useful packages for the community. Here's a glance at my work:

- [Croner](https://github.com/hexagon/croner) - JavaScript cron parser/scheduler. ESM. Node, Deno, Bun, Browser. No dependencies. 
- [Pup](https://github.com/hexagon/pup) - Fully featured process manager, written in typescript with love for Deno.
- [Base64](https://github.com/hexagon/base64) - Base64 and Base64url to string or arraybuffer. ESM. Node, Deno, Bun, Browser. No dependencies.
- [Minitz](https://github.com/hexagon/minitz) - Minimal timezone conversion library for JavaScript, written for Croner, but now it's own package. No dependencies.
- [Entsoe-api-client](https://github.com/hexagon/entsoe-api-client) - Unofficial ENTSO-e REST API Client for Deno and Node.
- [Bundlee](https://github.com/hexagon/bundlee) - Static file bundler for web frameworks supported by Deno (and usable on cli).
- [Proper-tags](https://github.com/Hexagon/proper-tags) - Modernised (pure ESM) version of the popular package `common-tags`.
- [DETRIS](https://github.com/Hexagon/detris) - Server side, web based multiplayer Tetris-like game written in Deno using Deno KV as persistent storage.
- (etc...)

Other than working on my own projects, I often find myself converting existing packages from Node-only CommonJS to Deno/Node/Bun ESM.
